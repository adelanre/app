# Build and Deploy Container

This is a sample/hello world Nodejs app.

## Your Task

- Containerize this application and deploy it to a sample GCP kubernetes cluster.
- There is no minimum or maximum amount of work but we expect that it will take about 20 hours. It could be much less if you're familiar with the tools. In that case you can "enhance" it to show off your skills.
- Once you have completed the task, email the URL, resulting dockerfile and yamls to <Manager Name> <manager email>.
## Additional Information
